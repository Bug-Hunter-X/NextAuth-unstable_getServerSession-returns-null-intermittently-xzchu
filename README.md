# NextAuth unstable_getServerSession returns null intermittently

This repository demonstrates an issue encountered when using `unstable_getServerSession` in NextAuth.js within a Next.js 15 application.

## Problem

The `unstable_getServerSession` function sometimes returns `null`, even when the user is successfully logged in. This leads to inconsistent access control and unexpected behavior. The issue appears to be intermittent, making it difficult to reproduce reliably.  This occurs primarily when navigating directly to the protected route (/about) and not when navigating from another page within the application. 

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Access the `/about` page directly (e.g., by typing the URL into the browser).
2. Observe that the page might show 'Access Denied' despite being logged in. Refreshing the page might resolve the issue sometimes.  Access the `/about` page from the home page, and it correctly shows the logged in content.

## Potential Causes

* **Next.js caching:** Potentially, the cached responses from the previous requests which may return an unauthenticated session when an authenticated session is expected.
* **Timing issue**  A race condition between the session check and the page rendering may be responsible for the issue.
* **NextAuth configuration:** Possibly an issue in the configuration of NextAuth.js.

## Proposed Solution

The solution provided in `aboutSolution.js` uses `getServerSideProps` to fetch the session before rendering the page, which ensures that the session is always available before rendering, thus eliminating the intermittent `null` return from `unstable_getServerSession`.  It also illustrates how to correctly implement authentication with NextAuth and Next.js 15 using `getServerSideProps`.
